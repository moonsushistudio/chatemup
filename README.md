# chatemup

A real-time audio language translator app. Written in NodeJS. Powered by ChatGPT and Whisper APIs.

how to use:
Just hit the green mic button and talk in your native language.
Translation process will start if no audio is detected for 2 seconds. So roughly every sentence spoken will save an audio clip that is sent to whisper/GPT for translation.  
The last four sentences spoken are sent to ChatGPT to help it understand context and improve translation.

project setup:
Add a .env file with your OpenAI API key.
Install required packages and run in your fav dev environment locally or deploy to the cloud..
